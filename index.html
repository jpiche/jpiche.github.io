      <p>
        With 20+ years of experience working in software engineering, I've developed expertise in a
        wide set of technologies, and have gained valuable experience leading engineering teams
        small and large.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an engineering leader I've helped guide developers through their careers and mentored
        many to help hone their skills in the ever changing landscape of new languages and
        frameworks. As an architect I've designed and implemented innovative strategies for
        maintaining or refactoring large codebases without the need for costly rewrites. And as
        a developer I built iOS & Android apps, APIs, backend tools, and web apps for small
        businesses and large enterprises alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am actively looking for my next long term position. If you are looking for someone
        with my skillset to lead a team, or are feeling social, you can email me at <em>j at jpiche dot com</em>.
      </p>

        Of course I have a number of interests outside programming too. Of paramount importance is
        Philosophy, which I have spent years studying. I also play
        Go (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">the board game</a>), read sci-fi as
        often as I can, and drink a bit too much coffee.
