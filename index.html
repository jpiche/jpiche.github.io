      <p>
        Software Engineer, Team Lead, Executive, and Consultant with 20+ years of experience
        working in and alongside startups and enterprise companies. I have a broad swath of
        experience across Software Engineering including building native iOS &amp; Android
        apps, API development, web development, systems architecture, and management of teams
        of engineers both large and small.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current full-time position is Engineering Manager for <a href="https://linus.health/">Linus Health</a>,
        a startup focused on providing digital cognitive assessments using AI to help with
        detection and intervention in brain health.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not currently accepting new consulting projects at this time, but if you have a
        tech question or are feeling social, you can email me at <em>j at jpiche dot com</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course I have a number of interests outside programming too. Of paramount importance is
        Philosophy, which I have spent years studying. I also play
        Go (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">the board game</a>), read sci-fi as
        often as I can, and drink a bit too much coffee.
